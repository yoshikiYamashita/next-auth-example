# tried next auth v^3.29.0
I wanted to use custom models by the way nextauth shows me. it is basically overriding the built-in User class and adding new fields. but that didn't work as I expected (seems the schema i created was being ignored). I've tried the exact same as the doc and tried the possible solutions that matched on the internet but never made it. so I gave up trying because there are not much documentation about it out there. I might try this with next-auth 4-beta version.
